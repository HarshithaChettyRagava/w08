Just hold your horses, Bill! Let's think about this for a moment.

My brother and sister had a big argument about the television yesterday, but it was just a storm in a teacup.

He's not right for this role, he has his head in the clouds.

My heart's in my mouth ever time it rings.

Barking up the wrong tree.

Big fish in a small pond.

Cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey.

If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.
